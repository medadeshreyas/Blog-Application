Swagger-UI 
```bash
At present, Swagger does not support cookie-based authorization. The team will look into implementing it once Swagger provides the necessary features to support it.
```

## Important Note


- At present, Swagger does not support cookie-based authorization. The team will look into implementing it once Swagger provides the necessary features to support it.


- When utilizing the PostMan software, ensure that the request includes embedded cookies as JWT authentication is implemented as a cookie-based authentication mechanism.


- The roles have already been established within the database. Ensure that the appropriate requests are executed for both the Admin and User roles.


- It's important to note that an Admin is also considered as a User. Only Users with Admin privileges have the ability to create additional Admins within the database.


- The expiration time limit for JWT tokens is 20 minutes. Subsequently, a new login session is required after the 20-minute duration.
